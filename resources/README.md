## ch
The *ch* file is the Swiss keyboard layout, adding a custom layout for using on US keyboard.  
The only different with the standard Swiss layout are the characters \ > < which, in the default Swiss layout, use a key which doesn't exist on US keyboards.  
I also find it more efficient to use, even on Swiss keyboards.
